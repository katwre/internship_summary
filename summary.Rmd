#' patternMatrix
#' Currently the function is available on a different branch for development. You can install the version of methylKit that has the segmentation functionality as shown below. We will move it to the master branch once we have more feedback for the function.


#add Travis CI for auto-testing
#everytime new code is pushed to github travis CI automatically runs R CMD CHECK
#see here: http://jtleek.com/protocols/travis_bioc_devel/

#subsetting scoreMatrix or scoreMatrixList still returns an appropriate object
#the following functions and similar ones should be added: these are for subsetting, maybe we also need a function like c() to add more elements to a scoreMatrixList
#uncomment examples
#Create arithmetic functions for ScoreMatrix and ScoreMatrixList
#write functions that:
#    add at least two ScoreMatrices and ScoreMatrixLists (element-wise, l1[i] + l2[i])
#    subtract at least two ScoreMatrices and ScoreMatrixLists
#That can be BigWig files from forward and reverse strand (ScoreMatrix from '-' strand is multiplied by -1) or from the same strands.
#multiHeatMatrix argument defines which matrices are used for clustering
